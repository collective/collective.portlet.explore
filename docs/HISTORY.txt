Changelog
=========

1.0 - unreleased
----------------

- Explicitly disable event bubbling for twistie clicks. This is not an issue
  for the standard markup, but makes things easier for customizations which
  put the twistie inside an anchor.

- Correctly set the CSS class for the twistie for already opened folders
  to exapendedNode.

- Rename local kss module to browser to prevent conflicts with top level
  kss.
